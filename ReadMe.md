# QA DEMO

This project is a sample project demonstrating the use of Playwright for automated testing.

## Installation

Before running tests, you need to install Playwright. You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g playwright
```

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Usage
To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```
To show the report after execution, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Note

Let me know if there's any questions so I can help to solve those doubts, I would appreciate if we can chat and see other approaches, I didn't have much time, so I decided to create the framework in this way using PlayWright and TypeScript.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
